# Carbook

Carbook is a parking app and parking sharing app. The concept was planted in the business planing seminar at the KIT. The Idea is to develope a social parking network to recommend parking places based on: Scannes of satellite images, users recommendations and partnerships with parking houses and rent them. Moreover users can register their personal parking places to rent them to other users.
