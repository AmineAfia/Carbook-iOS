# Carbook

Carbook is a parking app and parking sharing app. The idea was planted in the business planing seminar at the KIT. The Idea is to develope a car social network to recommend parking places based on: Scannes of satellite images, users recommendations and partnerships with parking houses. Moreover users can register their personal parking places to rent them using the app.
